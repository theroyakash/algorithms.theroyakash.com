## What is this?
This material categorizes coding interview problems into a set of **8 patterns**. Each pattern will be a complete tool - consisting of **data structures**, **algorithms**, and **analysis techniques** - to solve a specific category of problems. The goal is to build an understanding of the _underlying pattern_ so that we can apply that pattern to solve other problems.

**Complete guide and roadmap for SDE I and SDE II algorithm round.**
