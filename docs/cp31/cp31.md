# CP 31 sheet
This sheet is curated by Priyansh31dec. Can be found [here](https://www.tle-eliminators.com/cp-sheet). This part of the website contains solutions I submitted for the problems in the popular CP31 sheet.

CP 31 sheet is divided into ratings $\in (800, 900, 1000, 1100, \dots 1900)$. For each rating we have a total of 31 tasks to solve. I recommend starting from $800$ rated problems itself.
